# Checking for and installing updates

Depending on how you installed SlackerNews, the instructions to update will be similar. For example, if you installed using [Helm](/helm), you will use Helm to upgrade. 


## Helm

For Helm-based installations, upgrading is the same process as installation, but run `helm upgrade` instead of `helm install` with the same values. Update notifications and instructions are available in the app on <yourdomain>/admin/updates.
